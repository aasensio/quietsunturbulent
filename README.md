Bayesian analysis of the turbulent field in the quiet Sun

Long time ago, Stenflo & Lindegren and others analyzed many Fe I lines observed with
the FTS intrument to estimate upper limits for the turbulent magnetic field. These
studies were somehow phenomenological and this works tries to be much more 
elaborate. We use 1D semi-empirical models to explain the lines, together with a
magnetic field that induces a Zeeman broadening. We estimate the temperature from
all the lines at the same time and put a hierarchical prior for the field strength.
The aim is to obtain some information about B from all the lines at the same time,
taking into account all degeneracies of the problem.
